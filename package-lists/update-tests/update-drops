# These gcc41 obsoletes might look strange, but the reasoning is as follows:
# The default is to not deinstall packages which aren't on the media anymore
# The gcc41 packages are not on the CD/DVD, hence they would not be
# deinstalled automatically.  This is no problem, as they don't conflict with
# the gcc42 packages, but it would lead to accumulate old gcc packages.
# So we obsolete them from here.  But we do want to enable some users to
# install gcc41 packages in addition (from the ftp tree, or the build service).
# So we obsolete only old versions of the gcc41 packages, namely those which
# were on the 10.2.
